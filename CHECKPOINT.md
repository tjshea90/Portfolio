# CHECKPOINT 605 — read me first, then TASKS.md

**Written:** 2026-09-10T22:08:43Z · **tests:** all 2 fast checks green (gradle suite: see ship.sh)
**Branch:** `main` · **builds on:** `0e3effd` (this checkpoint is the commit after it)

## Just done
gated v7.9 (code 66) and pushed it. NOT yet built - GitHub has not been asked.

## Do this next
TRIGGER THE BUILD: mcp__github__actions_run_trigger, method run_workflow, workflow
android.yml, ref main, inputs {"full_build": "true"}. When that run is green,
send Tj the APK from the Release and then run:
  bash tools/record-release.sh v7.9 "note"

*(resuming? CLAUDE.md's "FIRST ACTION OF EVERY SESSION" comes before "Starting a session" — do that one first, or autosave stays off all session.)*

## Uncommitted right now
     M CHECKPOINT.md
     M app/build.gradle.kts
